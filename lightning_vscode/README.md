# MiniScript-Syntax README

MiniScript is a 3rd party scripting language for Unity.

This repository provides syntax highlighting files for Microsoft's VS Code (<https://code.visualstudio.com/>). It may
or may not work in other editors too!

## Features

Provides basic syntax highlighting for VS Code.

## Extension Settings

I've set this up to use the extension ms.

## Installation ##

To get your extension running in VS Code, copy the entire miniscript-syntax folder under your local extensions folder:

- Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions
- macOS/Linux: $HOME/.vscode/extensions

To check it's working, try opening "Example1.ms" from the examples folder.
